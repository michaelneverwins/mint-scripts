# mint-scripts
Simple scripts for personal use on Linux Mint Cinnamon Edition.

These were tested on Linux Mint 22 and whatever version of Cinnamon it uses, and I assume out of laziness that they do not strongly depend on my particular system configuration and will generally do what their names imply.

However, the scripts in this repository come with no warranty of any kind. Use them at your own risk and take full responsibility. Frankly, you should just read them and understand what they are doing before running them, because they are all short and simple.

On that note, I am not formally attaching any license to this repository just because I assume that the Bash code herein is too simple to be anyone's intellectual property. If I could copyright something of the form
```
if [ $(get foo) == true ]
then
    set foo false
else
    set foo true
fi
```
where `get` and `set` are programs written by someone else, and if I could actually enforce that copyright as if I were the first one to write such a script, then I'd soon be rich enough to buy Microsoft and force them to bring back Windows XP.

Of course, this presumed uncopyrightability applies only to the minimal amount of code you'll find here. Any plain English text such as comments and this README are obviously my own and all rights are reserved, not that anyone cares.
